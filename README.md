Google Suite is excellent. It connects everything you need in one friendly user interface. However, after creating your 314th Google Form, copying and pasting questions and answers, you'll begin to wonder if it's possible to automate some of these tasks. After discussions with a past teacher looking to do so, I was introduced to Google App Scripts, Google's scripting language for the G Suite platform. With this tool, connecting anything is possible.

This repository will contain the code for various tasks, such as automating the creation of Google Forms from a Google Spreadsheet, and each file will have its separate markdown file explaining the ins and outs of the program's application and potentially a YouTube video as well.
